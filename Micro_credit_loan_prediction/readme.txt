Objective of this project

This sample data is provided to our company from our client database. In order to improve the selection of customers for the credit, the client wants some predictions that could help them in further investment and improvement in selection of customers. 


Here I used to predict in terms of a probability for each loan transaction, whether the customer will be paying back the loaned amount within 5 days of insurance of loan. In this case, Label ‘1’ indicates that the loan has been payed i.e. Non- defaulter, while, Label ‘0’ indicates that the loan has not been payed i.e. defaulter.
